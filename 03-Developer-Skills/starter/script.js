//4 steps to solve any problem
//1. Make sure you understand the problem 100%. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem.
//  ex. Project Manager: "We need a function that reverses whatever we pass into it"
//  1. what does whatever mean? what is being passed in?
//  2. What do we do if something unexpected passes in?
//  3. What should be returned?
//  4. What does "reversed" mean in this context?
//  5. How to recognize what type the argument is
//  6. How to reverse something of any type

//2. Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems
//  sub problems:
//  1. check if argument is a number, a string, or an array
//  2. Implement reversing a number
//  3. Implement reversing a string
//  4. Implement reversing an array
//  5. Return reversed value

//3. Research as much as you need to
//  Research is a vital part of development

//4. Write pseudo-code before writing actual code, for bigger problems
